Hi, my name is Petar. I'm a software guy. 

I'm passionate about delivering software reliably to users(DevOps) with the help of the cloud(mostly AWS). I have a lot of experience doing Test-Driven Development as well as developing all kinds of systems - distributed processing, web, mobile, embedded, etc. 

I am also quite interested in product development, had at some point a quick flare with "utilitarian design" and other product-related skills.
